# QuasarUI's ControlNet Auxiliary Preprocessors

This is a rework of [quasarui_controlnet_preprocessors](https://github.com/Fannovel16/quasar_controlnet_preprocessors) based on [ControlNet auxiliary models by ðŸ¤—](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/controlnet_aux). I think the old repo isn't good enough to maintain.

YOU NEED TO REMOVE `quasarui_controlnet_preprocessors` BEFORE USING THIS REPO. THESE TWO CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. 

All old workflows still can be used with custom nodes in this repo but the version option won't do anything. Almost all v1 preprocessors are replaced by v1.1 except those doesn't apppear in v1.1.

You don't need to care about the differences between v1 and v1.1 lol.

The code is copy-pasted from the respective folders in https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/tree/main/annotator and connected to [the ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/Annotators).

# Updates
* `AIO Aux Preprocessor` intergrating all loadable aux preprocessors as dropdown options. Easy to copy, paste and get the preprocessor faster.
* Add OpenPose-format JSON output from OpenPose Preprocessor and DWPose Preprocessor. Checks [here](#faces-and-poses) .
* Fix wrong model path when downloading DWPose.

# Q&A:
* Why some nodes doesn't appear after I installed this repo?

This repo has a new mechanism which will skip any custom node can't be imported. If you meet this case, please create a issue on [Issues tab](https://github.com/Fannovel16/quasarui_controlnet_aux/issues) with the log from the command line.

# Installation:
## Using QuasarUI Manager (recommended):
Install [QuasarUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/QuasarUI-Manager) and do steps introduced there to install this repo.

## Alternative:
If you're running on Linux, or non-admin account on windows you'll want to ensure `/QuasarUI/custom_nodes` and `quasarui_controlnet_aux` has write permissions.

There is now a **install.bat** you can run to install to portable if detected. Otherwise it will default to system and assume you followed ConfyUI's manual installation steps. 

If you can't run **install.bat** (e.g. you are a Linux user). Open the CMD/Shell and do the following:
  - Navigate to your `/QuasarUI/custom_nodes/` folder
  - Run `git clone https://github.com/Fannovel16/quasarui_controlnet_aux/`
  - Navigate to your `quasarui_controlnet_aux` folder
    - Portable/venv:
       - Run `path/to/ComfUI/python_embeded/python.exe -s -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
	- With system python
	   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start QuasarUI

# Nodes
Please note that this repo only supports preprocessors making hint images (e.g. stickman, canny edge, etc).
All preprocessors except Inpaint are intergrated into `AIO Aux Preprocessor` node. 
This node allow you to quickly get the preprocessor but a preprocessor's own threshold parameters won't be able to set.
You need to use its node directly to set thresholds.

You can get [OpenPose-format JSON](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/02_output.md#json-output-format) from DWPose and OpenPose through two ways

For extension developers (e.g. Openpose editor):
```js
const poseNodes = app.graph._nodes.filter(node => ["OpenposePreprocessor", "DWPreprocessor"].includes(node.type))
for (const poseNode of poseNodes) {
    const openpose = JSON.parse(app.nodeOutputs[poseNode.id].openpose_json[0])
    console.log(openpose)
}
```

For API users:
Javascript
```js
import fetch from "node-fetch" //Remember to add "type": "module" to "package.json"
async function main() {
    const promptId = '792c1905-ecfe-41f4-8114-83e6a4a09a9f' //Too lazy to POST /queue
    let history = await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:8188/history/${promptId}`).then(re => re.json())
    history = history[promptId]
    const nodeOutputs = Object.values(history.outputs).filter(output => output.openpose_json)
    for (const nodeOutput of nodeOutputs) {
        const openpose = JSON.parse(nodeOutput.openpose_json[0])
        console.log(openpose)
    }
}
main()
```

Python
```py
import json, urllib.request

server_address = "127.0.0.1:8188"
prompt_id = '' #Too lazy to POST /queue

def get_history(prompt_id):
    with urllib.request.urlopen("http://{}/history/{}".format(server_address, prompt_id)) as response:
        return json.loads(response.read())

history = get_history(prompt_id)[prompt_id]
for o in history['outputs']:
    for node_id in history['outputs']:
        node_output = history['outputs'][node_id]
        if 'openpose_json' in node_output:
            print(json.loads(node_output['openpose_json'][0]))
